Bio Inspiration - Anatomy of human body part. 

The running gait cycle is characterized by having both feet off the ground during a cycle. The cycle is comprised of the stance and swing phase.  

During these phases calf muscles is the most activated group. It is responsible for forward propulsion and flexing movement during the cycle. 

The calf muscle group is connected to the calcaneus and its motion is dominated by ankle movement (Plantar flexion and dorsiflexion).
