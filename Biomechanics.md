# Biomechanics Background and Initial Specifications

###  Bioinspiration & assumption

Since our project would be dealing with the designing of a novel artificial muscle concept, we decided to start by finding a muscle group that we could use as a benchmark for designing and comparing our artificial muscle to. Doing so would give us an idea of the stiffness and forces to be replicated in our own Series Elastic Element (SEE) actuator and eventually, a novel artificial muscle concept. Thus, we needed tensions and stiffness data that directly correlated to Isometric and Isotonic muscle activation.

For this, we referred to various articles that dealt with muscle groups in Humans that were crucial to the gait modality of running. We chose running as it is one of the most highly cyclic and energetic movements of the human body. Furthermore, since most human gait related biomechanics studies were performed in controlled laboratory environments, we needed to be sure we had minimal - if not negligible differences between treadmill and open ground running when selecting the most performing muscle group. 

### Selection of muscle group to study:

For this, we used the data produced by Riley et al. [6]. Here, we found that the ankle joint produced the most moments. The table below shows some of the normalized moment data collected over 20 healthy Human subjects during running over treadmill:

|Joint | Moment (N-m/kg)|

---|---|---

Hip extension
1.3
Hip abduction
0.32
Knee flexion
1.7
Knee varus
1.5
Ankle plantarflexion
4.01
